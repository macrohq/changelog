# v3.0.3

### 📸 Camera Initialization
 - MacroCam had a lot of opportunities for improvement this week post-launch and we've made a TON of great updates for stability. The initialization process prevents weirdness on meeting start and toggled views and will also make the whole Macro experience much faster now!

### 📝 Bug Report
 - Debugging a desktop app is tough...so we've added a Bug Report button to help everyone out! Just go to View > Bug Report in the menu, fill out a description, and send the form email and we will look into the issue right away.

### 🗽 Onboarding Improvements
 - We found a few issues with onboarding where users would get stuck on the Zoom login screen or they would never be prompted to install MacroCam. We've fixed these issues and users should be able to complete onboarding without a hitch!
