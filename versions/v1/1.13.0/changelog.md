# v1.13.0

### 🙅‍♀️🙅‍♂️Interruption detection
- Let's face the facts, its easier to accidentally (or not accidentally) interrupt people in virtual meetings. The Airtime map now subtly indicates when an interruption is occurring to help avoid future interruptions! We've been tuning the criteria for what constitutes an interruption and would love your feedback here. See an interruption in your meeting that goes undetected? Let us know!

### 😄Live reactions
- Zoom reactions are a bit...stale. We've added *live* reactions to better share your feelings with your meeting participants. Click a live reaction to see what we mean!

### 🦋Improvements
- Webinar support is finally here!
- The ⌘M modal has been updated with a new design and quick access functionality
