# v1.10.0

### 🔭See everyone in the meeting
- There's a beautiful new way to see *everyone* in the meeting, even those without video. The most recent active speakers appear larger on your screen, while the rest of the participants are just a glance to the side.

### 💬A better way to chat
- Zoom chat... has some room for improvement. We've re-designed Zoom chat from the ground up. It works just the same for anyone you're chatting with who's not on Macro too. Soon you'll be able to instantly convert a chat into a note.

### 🖱️Share only what you want
- You can now choose exactly what screen or application you want to showcase when you start a screenshare.

### 🖌️Copy to clipboard
- If you don't use Google docs, or even if you do, you can now 1-click copy all the contents of your notes in Macro to your clipboard, to paste anywhere. Formatting included.

### 🖼️Rotating meeting backgrounds
- We've got new, daily rotating meeting backgrounds (not virtual/video backgrounds but rather the space between everyones videos thats typically a static black) that add a refreshing air of newness into your meetings. If you like the typical black background, you can always toggle this off in settings 🖤

### 🕹️Automatic View Toggling
- Macro now intelligently toggles your view when you start your own or begin viewing a screenshare (and toggles back after). As always, you can customize this in settings, and if you're so bold even set Macro to toggle your view anytime you click out of the meeting window 👀

### 🦋Bug fixes & improvements
- You can now re-size the screen share window. Huzzah!
- After a meeting the app now closes and restarts 3x faster 🐎
- When 'waiting for the host to let you in' you were previously stuck with that window smack dab in the middle of your screen. You can now move that around to freely do whatever-it-is-you-do when waiting for a meeting to start.
- Decreased Macro CPU utilization by ~15% in Pro View 🤖
