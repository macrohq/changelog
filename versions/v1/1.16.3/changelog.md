# v1.16.3

### 💬 Public Chat Fix 
 - There was a bug in the previous version that didn't allow users to see public chats (only DMs). This is now fixed!
 
### 🏎️ Zoom Protocol Pass-through
 - Macro leverages the Zoom protocol to automatically open. Some users found that attempting to log in to the Zoom client using OAuth caused Macro to open instead of Zoom. We've adjusted this to now only open meeting links in Macro!
