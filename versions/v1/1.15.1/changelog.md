# v1.15.1

### ðŸ§° Electron Updater Fix
 - After the most recent update, the electron-updater package was missing a dependency. This prevented users from being able to update to future releases. We've fixed this now so updates will be automatically downloaded like they should!

### ðŸ›º New Protocol Handler
 - Some users had Zoom open at the same time as Macro due to default settings on their computer. Now, Zoom links will only open Macro instead of both.
