# v1.13.6

### 💥Crash Reduction
 - As we've said in previous changelogs, Firestore has been causing trouble with Node in the Macro app. We've not moved to a new API with Firestore that should drastically reduce the number of crashes in meeting.
 
### 👍 Improvements
 - The Macro app has gone on a diet and lost quite a few MBs!
 - Our autoupdater was acting up for a few users so we updated the autoupdater!
