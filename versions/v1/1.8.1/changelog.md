# v1.8.1

### 🖼️ Virtual Backgrounds 
 - Downloading the Macro .pkg would not include all the required Zoom dependencies, breaking much-loved functionality like virtual backgrounds. Now, new and existing users should have no problem adding and setting virtual backgrounds!

### 🦟 Bug Fixes
 - The password input prompt occasionally appeared behind the launch window. Now it will appear front and center.
 - Certain characters (i.e. emojis 😞) would cause Macro to crash when typed in to Zoom chat. This is now fixed!
 - For some users, Macro would continually launch Zoom instead of Macro. This is now fixed and users can now always select between modes.
