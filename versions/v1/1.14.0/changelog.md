# v1.14.0

We've been quiet for a while... 

Over the last 3 weeks we haven't posted a changelog. We've been heads down working on making Macro a much more stable and reliable experience. A few highlights of what we've shipped:

- 🤫6 silent version updates to the app
- 🐛Found and fixed 23 unique app-crashing / severe bugs
- 📉Reduced app size from 430mb to 307mb (!!)
- 🔙Toggling views retains the position and size of the window when you return

And a whole lot more. These massive improvements were brought to you by our stellar engineering team 👏👏👏They've also been working on some infrastructure updates that are laying the groundwork for some brand new 💫features we have launching soon!
