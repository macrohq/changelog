# v1.13.1

### ðŸ™‹Error Reporting
 - As any engineer can tell you, remote debugging is tough. We've added Sentry to give us more introspection into bugs and crashes seen by Macro users so we can fix them sooner!

### ðŸ’½CPU Improvements
 - The airtime feature is a favorite of our users but it caused CPU strain. We've refactored airtime to be much more computationally friendly ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ¦ŸBug Fixes
 - An error in our native code would cause a sudden crash at the beginning of a meeting. We've fixed this.
 - Large meetings made Macro freak out when joining. With some finesse, we made Macro more robust to big Zooms.
