### 🎙️Updated Airtime Logic
 - The airtime map used to always show 'All Meeting' statistics in the tooltip and had adjustable graphical changes for 5 min & 30 min windows. Now, the intervals are fully synced and shown in both the tooltip and the graph!
 - Airtime moving averages are now synced across clients, making for a much smoother and more accurate airtime experience for all Macro users.

### 🦋 Bug Fixes
 - The Macro sidebar could occasionally remain open after being toggled off when toggling views. This is now fixed!
 - The participants button in Pro View would sometimes not sync when users left the meeting. The button should now display the actual count at all times.
