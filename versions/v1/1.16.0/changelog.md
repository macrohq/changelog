### 😮‍💨 Shareable Airtime
 - Ever wanted to share the airtime graph with someone on your team that wasn't on Macro? Now just click the `Share` button in the airtime map and share the link thru chat or copy the link to your clipboard!
 
### ☯️ To Macro, or not to Macro
 - We heard the feedback and we've added back the option to select launching your meeting in Macro *or* in Zoom. Now, you can either click what you want right away or wait 5 seconds to auto-launch in Macro.
