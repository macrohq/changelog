# v1.12.0

### 🥰Self View
- Seeing yourself in a large frame takes focus away from the meeting and leads to faster mental exhaustion (Zoom fatigue). We've designed a new self-view experience that isn't the main focus, but still lets you check how you appear to other attendees. You can toggle this in settings 🕹️

### 🔜Next meeting
- Macro now shows your next meeting underneath the time remaining for the current one!

### ♻️Convert a chat into a note
- Upon hover, you can convert a chat into a note 💥

### 🦋Improvements
- Normal zoom shortcuts for audio, video, and screen share are now live
- Names of participants show upon hovering over video frames
