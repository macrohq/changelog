# v1.8.0

### 🎉 New Collab view features!
- You've asked and we listened. We made the collab view controls *much* easier to find. Mouse over the always-present Macro icon and your meeting controls will be there to greet you.
- A new control we've added: the ability to move the videos anywhere you'd like! Move them to somewhere else on your screen, or even a different desktop or monitor. Just click & drag to move.

### 🤷‍♀️ Google not required
- Authorizing with Google is no longer required to use Macro! If you want to still pull in your calendar events to the homescreen, quick-launch into meetings, and have your notes automatically synced to a google doc then you'll still need the Google Oauth. But importantly, it's now optional.

### 🔙Having issues? You can use Zoom instead
- Since we're early there are still plenty of 🐛to find and squash. If you're having any issue getting into your meeting, now there's an option to launch right in with normal Zoom, on the same screen you were previously only choosing between Discussion / Collaboration view..
