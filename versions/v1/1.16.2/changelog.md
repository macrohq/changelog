# v1.16.2

### 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏿 Additional Participants Styling
 - With more than 6 people in a meeting, the additional participants in the side panel showed up a bit odd after changing some CSS. Now, the panel is vertically centered and looks great with more attendees!
 
### 📐 Settings Saving
 - We've added a `Save` button to the Preferences page to give users more clarity on when they are actually submitting their changes.
 
### 🤐 Airtime Share in Chat
 - The airtime `Share in chat` button was successfully sending the chat message but not showing up in Macro. We've got this all fixed now!
