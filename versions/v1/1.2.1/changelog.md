# v1.2.1

### 🔧 Zoom Error Handling
 - If there's ever a problem joining a meeting via Macro we now fall back to opening Zoom so you can still join on time!

### 🦋 UI Tweaks and Improvements
 - We're constantly making the new home screen and collaborative notepad easier to use and more visually appealing.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
 - Some Zoom URLs weren't being correctly read by our app. This is fixed to now support more URL patterns.
 - The app occasionally crashed when Zoom crashed. Now we gracefully handle those errors so Macro doesn't crash too.
