# v1.5.0

### 👻 The 'Houdini' - click behind video

- Now in Collab mode you can access things behind the video bubbles on the desktop! As you mouse over a video frame, it becomes transparent - along with the two adjacent video frames - letting you click on whatever is behind!

### Ⓜ️ ⌘+M

- We've got a new shortcut experience to access Macro when in Collab mode. At anytime, just press ⌘+M on your keyboard to bring up a slick new, ephemeral interface for taking and viewing notes in the meeting while not disrupting your meeting flow.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦See all participants

- In Collab mode, you can now click to see a list of all meeting participants so you know who's in the meeting besides the 6 immediately visible bubbles on your screen!
- If fewer than 6 meeting participants and someone has their video off, there's now a subtle indicator of the number of non-video participants so you're not left wondering where the voice-with-no-video is coming from!

### ⚙️Settings

- Finally...Macro settings! From your Mac menu bar you can access Macro (and Zoom) settings from Macro > Preferences.

### 🐛Bug Fixes

- Occasionally the airtime map would get wonky in 2 person meetings, that's been fixed!
