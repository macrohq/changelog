# v1.9.3

### 📽️ Resizable Screen Share
 - When in Pro View, the screen share used to be one size fits all. Now, the window starts maximized and is completely resizable! 

### 🚄 Quicker Launch Speed
 - We've made some technical updates behind-the-scenes that make launching into a meeting that much faster.

### 📧 New Preferences
 - Post-meeting email, default airtime interval, screen share behavior...we've added these settings and more for you to customize your Macro experience even more.
