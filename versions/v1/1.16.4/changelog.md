# v1.16.4

### ⛰️ Big Sur Updates
 - With many of our users on Big Sur now, we had to update a few things to enable existing functionality on the new OS. Now, the .dmg is also more accessible due to code signing updates.
 
### 📺 Screenshare Permissions
 - Some users were not getting prompted for screensharing permissions on onboarding. This should be fixed for all new users.
 
### 🏎️ Auto-open Zoom Links 
 - We've refactored the way the code for auto-opening Zoom links works which should decrease the number of launch issues when clicking Zoom links in your browser.
