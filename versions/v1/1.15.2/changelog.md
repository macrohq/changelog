# v1.15.2

### ðŸ¥¯Beta Login Update
 - Due to idiosyncrasies and changes in the Zoom login flow, we've updated the login flow to connect your Zoom account. We are cautiously optimistic this will unblock folks who got stuck while initially setting up Macro.

### ðŸ¥‘Basic View Removal
 - Pro View >>>. No more side panel next to the default Zoom window...now everyone is immersed in the top notch customized UI that makes Zoom look 10x better.

### ðŸ”¬App Focus Fixes
 - In collab mode, Macro would occasionally pull focus when it shouldn't. Even though it just wants more attention, we've fixed this now!
