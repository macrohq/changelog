# v1.9.0

### 😎Pro View

- A completely redesigned meeting interface with gobs of transparency, useful widgets, and more. Pro View lets you switch between a larger video-wall style display and a more subtle small-bubble collaborative display anytime you want during the meeting.  A ~~picture~~ GIF is worth a thousand words:

### ✍️Editable Notes

- Notes are now fully editable, even after categorization. Change categories, update text, or delete all right within the meeting interface

### 🖼️Virtual Backgrounds

- They are fixed, for real this time. And even better Macro now ports over your existing virtual backgrounds from Zoom. We've even thrown in some custom Macro-backgrounds for you to check out ;)
