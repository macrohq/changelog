# v1.11.1

### 💬 Chat -> Note
 - Ever received a chat message that you wanted to save for later? Hover over the message and click the '...' to convert any message to a note.
 
### 🗑️ Google Doc Garbage Collection
 - Macro always creates a new Google Doc for each meeting. Now, if the meeting has no notes we silently delete the doc so your Drive stays uncluttered.
 
### 🐞 Bug Fixes
 - Updated the screenshare functionality in Pro View to improve usability.
 - Fixed an intermittent backend communication bug that prevented Macro from opening.
 - Added extra retries for Firestore to guarantee note-taking functionality.
 - Ensured that the airtime user list was always accurate, even with multiple users with the same name.
