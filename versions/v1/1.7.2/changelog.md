# v1.7.2

### ðŸ¦— Bug Fixes
 - Sometimes Macro would not automatically launch you in to a meeting after clicking a Zoom link. We've made this more sturdy!
 - Occasionally closing a window would not fully close the app. This should no longer happen.
 - The meeting timer was missing sporadically. It should now always show up in discussion mode!
