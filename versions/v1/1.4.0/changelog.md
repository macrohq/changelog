# v1.4.0

### 🛎️Enhanced notifications in Collab Mode

- We've added extra notifications in collab mode when people are joining/leaving the meeting, waiting to be let in, sharing screen, and more!

### ⏲️Outcomes with timestamps and authors

- Categorized notes now show the time at which they were taken and who wrote them! No more playing guess who with multiple Macro users in the same meeting.

### 🐛Bug Fixes

- Computer display no longer falls asleep if in Collab mode 😴
- Sometimes Macro wouldn't automatically launch after installing, that's been fixed.
- Occasionally would try and launch too quickly after clicking a Zoom link and would error out, we've eased back on the throttle for smooth sailing
