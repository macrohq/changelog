# v1.15.3

### 🐞App Behavior Improvements
 - The auto update had the potential to close out of Macro at the beginning of a meeting unexpectedly. We now wait until the meeting is over to complete the update process.
 - Clicking a link while on the home screen would not open the meeting right away. Now, any time a Zoom link is clicked it will launch the meetig immediately.
 - Fixed some design / layout inconsistencies in a few of our modals.
