# v1.7.0

### 🐛 Bug fixes
 - Occasionally Macro wouldn't launch properly when you clicked on a Zoom link. Have no fear - links are in the clear! (That's been fixed). 
 - Trying to enter a meeting ID into the Macro home screen would cause the app the crash 😱 Meeting IDs are now good to go.
 - The control panel in Collaboration View would sometimes be tricky to find - we've made it easier to show so you can access your meetings settings much faster. 
 
### 🔺 A place for feedback
 - We've setup feedback.macro.io for you to submit any bugs you encounter or feature requests you think of! 
 - Some awesome ideas submitted by users that will be coming soon: Draggable collab video bubbles, in meeting- switching between discussion & collab view, and editable notes
