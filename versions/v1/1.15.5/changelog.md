# v1.15.5

### üì∏ Powered By Zoom
 - Since Macro uses Zoom's custom UI, Zoom places a lovely `Powered By Zoom` logo on some videos during the meeting. As this is quite annoying, we've masked that part of the video so all you see is people, not text.

### ‚è∫Ô∏è Cloud Recording
 - Recording is now natively built in to Macro! Just use the record button in the bottom right to start and stop a cloud recording.

### üôå Improvements
 - We added a modal that informs users about the ability to Switch to Zoom via the menu bar or CMD+Shift+B at any time in a Macro meeting.
 - When breakout rooms are started, we will now automatically prompt the user to switch to Zoom to join them.
 - We've updated to the new Zoom SDK!
