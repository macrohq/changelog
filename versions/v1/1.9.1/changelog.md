# v1.9.1

### üêú Bug Fixes
 - In the new Pro View, the data in the two modes would not always be synced. This is now fixed and should be the same regardless of toggling!
 - Leaving the Macro home screen open for many hours would lead to slow meeting launch times. We now refresh the window in the background to ensure a quick meeting launch.
 - Some zoom.us links were being picked up as meeting links when they shouldn't have. One updated regex and this should no longer happen.
