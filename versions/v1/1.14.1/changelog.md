# v1.14.1

### ðŸ¦‹ Improvements
 - We removed a race condition in the app that would cause notes to break if many people joined the room at the beginning of the meeting.
 - Very rarely, the videos could separate from the Macro window. This has been fixed!
 - Waiting for a meeting to launch could occasionally close the meeting window prematurely. We've fixed this which should get rid of crashes at the beginning of a meeting for some folks.
