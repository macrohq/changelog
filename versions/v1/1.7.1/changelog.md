# v1.7.1

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
 - You told us preferences is normally Command + , so we updated that!
 - Macro now auto-restarts when an update has been downloaded.
 - If you don't take any notes, there won't be an empty Google Doc in the email anymore.
 - Macro sometimes stayed open when you closed a window. This is fixed!
