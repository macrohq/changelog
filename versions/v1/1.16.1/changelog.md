# v1.16.1

### 🐝 Bug Fixes
 - The next meeting was not showing for some users. We've fixed this for all Macro users.
 - Occasionally, the current meeting shown was not the same as the meeting for that Zoom link. The Google integration now checks to see if the Zoom link matches that meeting to give you the most accurate current meeting info.
 - With a new Zoom update, the gradient background we add was being auto-set. We've removed this, but you may need to remove the background in Zoom Settings -> Backgrounds and Filters for it to go away forever 😥
 - Private messages sent by the user were occasionally not showing up in the chat window. This has been fixed!
 - The new autolaunch window was malfunctioning for some users due to settings updates. Now the launch sequence will follow whatever you set in the Macro or Zoom window.
 - Some settings were getting updated without the user changing the checkboxes. This no longer occurs.
