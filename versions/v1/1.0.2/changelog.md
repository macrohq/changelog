- Many of you have been loving and sending feedback on the airtime map - we've given it a fresh coat of paint that now dynamically highlights the active speaker.
- When you hover over a participants bubble, you'll see their full name, and their airtime stats broken down as a % and in minutes+seconds format.

### 🏎 Faster app launch

- When clicking a meeting link, Macro now launches and joins your meeting 50% faster! 
Zoom Zoom.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- When joining a Zoom meeting, sometimes the connect-audio modal would disappear - no more! You'll automatically be connected to the meeting via computer audio from here on out.
- The header of the Macro window would occasionally disappear 😱, that's been fixed.

### 🔺 Zoom SDK update

- We've updated to the latest and greatest version of the Zoom SDK, containing the most recent security features (GCM encryption), and more.
