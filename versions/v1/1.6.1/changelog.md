### ‚û∞ Retry Google Login
 - Right now, Macro requires Zoom and Google login to work properly. If you somehow get kicked out of onboarding mid-flow, we now re-open the Google login screen so you can finish getting set up.

### üêú Google API Error Handling
 - Some times the Google APIs like to act up. Now if they do, Macro does everything it can to work around it and stay working throughout your meeting.
