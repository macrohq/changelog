# v1.3.1

### 🔔Collab Mode Notifications
 - With the new collab mode UI, we have meeting notifications built-in. Now admit new attendees and view a shared screen directly below the toolbar!

### 📺Prioritized Video
 - Even if you aren't talking, Macro prioritizes your video as the first tile should you choose to show self-view. Sometime you just want to look in the mirror 😉

### ‼️Double-open Fix
 - We fixed an issue where opening a new Zoom URL during a Macro meeting caused the app to malfunction.
