# v1.13.4

### 🔗 Clickable Links 
 - Links added in a note used to not be clickable in Macro. Now not only can you click links in both chat and notes, but we have also trimmed the links for better readability!

### 🚄 In-meeting Speed Up
 - We've been working these past few weeks to make the Macro experience faster while in a meeting. Although it's an ongoing goal to keep getting faster, this release is the first step in the speed up!

### 🐝 Bug Fixes
 - Onboarding was broken for a few people depending on how they log in. This is now fixed.
 - Timezones got messed up for some users in the post-meeting email. We now adjust the date based on the timezone you're in!
 - We've continued to work on crashes due to an issue with Firestore. The newest patch for this bug is out in this release.
