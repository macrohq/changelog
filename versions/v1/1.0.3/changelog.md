# v1.0.3

### ☁️ Over-the-air updating

- The days of reinstalling Macro every time we launch a new feature are no more... 
Whenever we’ve made Macro even better, you’ll be prompted to automatically upgrade from the app itself - at the end of your meeting!

### ⏰ Loading screen

- We've added a launch screen with a 🆒loading spinner as soon as Macro launches, so you confidently know that you're being chauffeured into your meeting.

### 🙈 Collapsable sections

- The Macro notepad and outcomes sections can now be collapsed/uncollapsed as often as your heart desires.

### 🔍 Always in focus

- Now the Macro sidebar window is magically 🔮always in focus. No more extra clicks when you need to switch between the main video UI and the sidebar.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Sometimes Macro wouldn’t join a meeting when coming from a Zoom link in Gcal. We updated our URL parsing to handle opening any Zoom link, from anywhere
- Along similar lines, Zoom would occasionally open at the same time when Macro opened. Separation anxiety...we've made it clear to Zoom that we can handle your meetings ourselves 💪
