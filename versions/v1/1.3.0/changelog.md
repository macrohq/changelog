# v1.3.0

### ✨Collaboration Mode

- Tired/annoyed/frustrated by Zoom taking up your whole screen and blocking you from getting *actual work* done with your team? Shift into collab mode - a **brand new interface** for zoom that shapes and organizes video into a more natural way to work with your team
- Choose either Discussion (standard) or Collaboration Mode before you launch into every meeting - all from your familiar Zoom links.

### 🏁App launch speed

- With some under the hood improvements, Macro now launches even faster right into your meetings.

### 🆘Help is just a click away

- We've got new button that lets you chat directly with us in the app if you're experiencing any issues with Macro!

### 😎Joined via Macro

- If you're using Macro to join a meeting, your participant name will have a subtle 'joined via Macro' appended!

### 💨Airtime in large meetings

- If you're in a large meeting, the airtime map now intelligently displays only the top 12 participants by airtime percentage, no more cluttered maps with lots of participants (some of you have some *huge* meetings...)
