# v1.15.0

### 👉Automatic view toggling
- Whenever you've switched away from the meeting to another app on your computer, fully covering up your meeting, Macro will automatically toggle views. This helps you feel present with your team, while still letting you go about your business!
- The first time your view automatically toggles, Macro will call it out and make sure you'd like to keep this behavior turned on. If not, you can change this anytime in settings 🖤

### 🔻Even lower app size
- How it started: 430MB
- Now: 273MB 💥

### 🐎Even faster app launch
- Fastest launches yet, and we've got more improvements coming. Whether clicking a link or hitting  launch from the homescreen, Macro gets you into your meetings @fast
