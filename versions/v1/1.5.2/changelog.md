# v1.5.2

### ⚓ New and Improved Onboarding Flow
 - Macro is made to be open for all and this means new users self-onboard. We upgraded the onboarding flow to make getting set up even easier.

### 🎧 Auto-join audio and video in Collab Mode
 - No one wants to fumble around to find how to connect their audio to Zoom. Macro now automatically joins you to the call when joining thru Collab mode.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
 - Occasionally notifications would not appear in Collab mode then people asked for entry in to the meeting. This has been fixed!
