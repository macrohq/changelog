# v1.8.2

### 📝 Edit, Move, and Delete Outcomes
 - Macro outcomes used to be permanent. Once you categorized something in-app, it was there to stay. You can now edit notes in place, recategorize them, or even delete them if you want to try again!
 
### ⚙️ Same Virtual Backgrounds, Same Settings
 - When you downloaded Macro before, your Zoom virtual backgrounds and settings weren't ported over. Now, enjoy the backgrounds you love and the settings you want.
